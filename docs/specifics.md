# Specifics

VYL is a community-driven language, it runs off of the idea of a smart compiler, the compiler will be able to optimize the code to the best of its ability, and it will be able to generate code that is as fast as possible. So far, the compiler is memory safe and will let the user know if there is a memory leak or buffer overflow.
